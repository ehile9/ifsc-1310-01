       <h2>Old Reliable</h2> 
        
       <p> Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
        
        Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only<em>slight</em>  side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing of his pulse.</p>
<article><h2>Gordo</h2><p>
    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordo_(monkey)"><strong>Gordo</strong> was one of the first monkeys to travel into space. As part of the NASA space program, Gordo, also known as <strong>Old Reliable</strong>, was launched from Cape Canaveral on December 13, 1958, in the U.S. PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on its AM-13 mission. The rocket would travel over 1,500 miles and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic. A technical malfunction prevented the capsule's parachute from opening and, despite a short search, neither his body nor the vessel were ever recovered.<sup>[1]</sup></blockquote></p>

<h3>Gordo's Bros</h3>
        <p>Gordo was the youngest of four monkeys in his family. His three older brother are as follows below in order of youngest to oldest:</p>

<li>Gary</li>
<li>Greg</li>
<li>Groucho</li>

        <h4>The Mission</h4>
        
        <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>
        
       <p> <q>We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work.</q>

        <h5>The Jupiter AM-13</h5>
        
        The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.
        
        Flight Date: December 13, 1958
        Launch Time: 03.53 EST
        
        
        <h4>The Journey</h4>
        
        Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding achievements of space research.
        
        Flight Time: 15 Minutes
        Apogee: 310 Miles

        <h4> The Other Monkeys in Space</h4>
        <p> There were many different types of monkeys used in the space program.  Below is a list of the most common primates used in the space program.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rhesus Macaque</li>
    <li>Crab-Eating Macaque</li>
    <li>Squirrel Monkeys</li>
    <li>Pig-Tailed Macaques</li>
    <li>Chimpanzees</li>
</ul>
<p>Now all these animals might seem like a the same thing with a little different name. So we have broken them up for you to do a little more explaining.</p>
