  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p id="progressive">
     Progressive enhancement is a best practices approach to inclusive web development. It is the
    flip side to the graceful degradation approach of building websites/applications that work on
    the newest, most up to date browser or platform with the intention of creating patches or fixes
    for outdated browsers. Unfortunately, the latter approach usually leaves the older versions
    with poor or inoperable sites. This also seems to be more cumbersome for the developers than
    a progressive enhancement approach. Progressive enhancement begins with a basic platform that will work well across all browsers with additional enhancements layered in to change according to the level of sophistication on the end users interface, giving a win/win situation for all (inclusivity). From what I have read it seems that it is much like the
    web standards of separating html, css, &amp; javascript from one-another. It also seems to work as
    somewhat of an extension to accessibility standards as well. So why wouldn’t it just be the way
    things are done? It would seem to come back to teaching old dogs new tricks and short sided
    mindsets of expecting clients evolve to developers rather than the other way around. In the
    end, as a developer we should try to serve as large a community as possible while staying
    innovative which speaks to web standards, accessibility and progressive enhancement. For
    some additional readings check out the following links that put things into perspective fairly
    well for beginners like me: </p>

  <h2>&lsquo;Thoughts On Web Accessibility&rsquo;</h2>

 <p> Web accessibility has not really covered much of my internal radar, I’m a little embarrassed to say.  I remember hearing about it last semester and thinking that it would not affect me much.  I felt this way because I will not primarily be focused on web development.  I ran into this same type of mindset in the construction field as well.  In commercial construction ADA compliance is huge but in residential there are less requirements.  And although these compliance requirements do add to your necessary skillset, it is no different than learning to punctuate sentences or proper orders of operation in any trade.  Web accessibility does not just pertain to web pages, it is a branch of a growing and necessary push for diversity, equity and inclusion across all digital technologies.  The deficiencies, solutions and vulnerabilities will all be both exposed and aided by artificial intelligence.  Diversity, equity and inclusion should be part of the “Standards of Practice” in all the digital occupations.
 <p><strong> Derek Featherstone’s</strong> video on web accessibility really opened my eyes to how varied web accessibility needs to be.  Considering that we will have a growing age population, the diversity of the accessibility needs are quite likely to grow as well.  The World Health Organization declared in 2018 that upwards of one billion people need assistive technology.  And they expect that figure to rise to more that two billion by the year 2050.  According to the WHO website as of 9/30/2023:</p>
    <cite>“WHO estimates that today 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, or apps that support communication and cognition.”</cite>
  <p>So the need is here and will continue to grow for inclusivity in the digital revolution that is unfolding.  The consulting company Gartner has developed a “Market Guide for Digital Accessibility”.  
  According to Gartner:</p>
   <cite> “Digital accessibility is no longer a choice; it’s a requirement. In addition to training and process updates, software engineering leaders must assess platform and service vendors in a complex and crowded market. This guide will help them make informed purchasing decisions.”  (Gartner 2023)</cite>
 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2CNW8S4P&ct=230223&st=sb">Market Guide for Digital Accessibility</a>
 <p> In this article Gartner pointed out that digital accessibility will be required of software engineers to ensure that the products they create comply with regulations.  And that regulations are quite varied from region to region.  In order to win government contracts accessibility standards will need to be met.  And what it sounds like to me is that we are headed in the direction the W3C took the web with HTML standards.  In fact the W3C addresses accessibility on their site as well with the “Web Accessibility Initiative” (WAI).  And the United Nations has regulations in place for accessibility standards.</p>
  
 <p> So, although this was supposed to be about web accessibility, I think web accessibility is part of a larger movement toward ethical digital practices that strive to propel all of humanity forward with diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
