  <h2>&lsquo;Thoughts On Web Accessibility&rsquo;</h2>

 <p> Web accessibility has not really covered much of my internal radar, I’m a little embarrassed to say.  I remember hearing about it last semester and thinking that it would not affect me much.  I felt this way because I will not primarily be focused on web development.  I ran into this same type of mindset in the construction field as well.  In commercial construction ADA compliance is huge but in residential there are less requirements.  And although these compliance requirements do add to your necessary skillset, it is no different than learning to punctuate sentences or proper orders of operation in any trade.  Web accessibility does not just pertain to web pages, it is a branch of a growing and necessary push for diversity, equity and inclusion across all digital technologies.  The deficiencies, solutions and vulnerabilities will all be both exposed and aided by artificial intelligence.  Diversity, equity and inclusion should be part of the “Standards of Practice” in all the digital occupations.
 <p><strong> Derek Featherstone’s</strong> video on web accessibility really opened my eyes to how varied web accessibility needs to be.  Considering that we will have a growing age population, the diversity of the accessibility needs are quite likely to grow as well.  The World Health Organization declared in 2018 that upwards of one billion people need assistive technology.  And they expect that figure to rise to more that two billion by the year 2050.  According to the WHO website as of 9/30/2023:</p>
    <cite>“WHO estimates that today 2.5 billion people need one or more assistive products such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, or apps that support communication and cognition.”</cite>
  <p>So the need is here and will continue to grow for inclusivity in the digital revolution that is unfolding.  The consulting company Gartner has developed a “Market Guide for Digital Accessibility”.  
  According to Gartner:</p>
   <cite> “Digital accessibility is no longer a choice; it’s a requirement. In addition to training and process updates, software engineering leaders must assess platform and service vendors in a complex and crowded market. This guide will help them make informed purchasing decisions.”  (Gartner 2023)</cite>
 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2CNW8S4P&ct=230223&st=sb">Market Guide for Digital Accessibility</a>
 <p> In this article Gartner pointed out that digital accessibility will be required of software engineers to ensure that the products they create comply with regulations.  And that regulations are quite varied from region to region.  In order to win government contracts accessibility standards will need to be met.  And what it sounds like to me is that we are headed in the direction the W3C took the web with HTML standards.  In fact the W3C addresses accessibility on their site as well with the “Web Accessibility Initiative” (WAI).  And the United Nations has regulations in place for accessibility standards.</p>
  
 <p> So, although this was supposed to be about web accessibility, I think web accessibility is part of a larger movement toward ethical digital practices that strive to propel all of humanity forward with diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
